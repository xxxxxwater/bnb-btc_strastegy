# CTA_Strastegy
41.88CAGR %、0.28 Drawdown。（V4版本）


2.目前是超优化的版本。策略是经过删减时间序列(不做预测)模型和深度学习模块超优化纯指标计算（高性能的计算设备）加载至少三年的交易数据数据，此版本（v2版本）仍然可以通过动态止盈和高回归的币种实现19%CRAHR/2.78%drawdown。
3.用于版本迭代，这个策略每笔信号触发获利都很少。大概部分都是少利润堆积起来的，然后加了熔断机制暂停机制过滤黑天鹅。平摊到每个信号交易的获利大概在千4，对标的要求极高的流动性和自回归。
# CTA_Strastegy
41.88CAGR%, 0.28 Drawdown. (V4 version)
2. Currently it is a super optimized version. The strategy is to load at least three years of trading data through the super optimized pure indicator calculation (high-performance computing equipment) of the deleted time series (no prediction) model and deep learning module. This version (v2 version) can still achieve 19% CRAHR/2.78% drawdown through dynamic stop profit and high regression currency.

3. For version iteration, this strategy has very little profit for each signal trigger. Probably part of it is accumulated from small profits, and then the circuit breaker mechanism is added to the suspension mechanism to filter out black swans. The profit spread to each signal transaction is about 4,000, and the benchmark requires extremely high liquidity and autoregression.
